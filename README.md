# ML

In this repository I am experimenting with handmade machine learning.

I'm following Andrej Karpathy's ["Zero to Hero"](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) series.

I use pytorch to create and train the networks and plan to implement forward passes in C# to use the trained networks in a .NET environment.
